📘 Encapsulation – Notes
🔹 Definition

Encapsulation is the OOP principle of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to data to ensure controlled modification.

🔹 Purpose

Protects data from unauthorized access

Ensains data integrity through validation

Improves code maintainability

Hides internal implementation details


🔹 How It Is Achieved

Declare class variables as private

Provide public getter and setter methods

Use access modifiers (private, public, protected, default)


🔹 Key Features

Supports data hiding

Provides controlled access

Prevents accidental data modification

Increases program security

Reduces system complexity


🔹 Real-World Example

ATM Machine

Cash inside ATM → private data

Buttons on ATM → public methods

User cannot directly access cash
