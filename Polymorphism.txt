📘 Polymorphism in Java – Quality Notes
🔹 Definition

Polymorphism means “one name, many forms”.
In Java, it allows the same method or object reference to behave differently based on the actual object type.

🔹 Types of Polymorphism
1) Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding)

✔ Achieved using Method Overloading

2) Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)

✔ Achieved using Method Overriding

.

📘 Compile-Time Polymorphism – Quality Notes
🔹 Definition

Compile-time polymorphism is the ability of a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, where the method call is resolved at compile time.

It is also called Static Polymorphism or Method Overloading.

🔹 How It Is Achieved

Through Method Overloading

Same method name

Different parameter list (number, type, or order)



📘 Run-Time Polymorphism – Quality Notes
🔹 Definition

Run-time polymorphism is the ability of a parent class reference to refer to a child class object, where the method to be executed is decided at runtime instead of compile time.

It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch.

🔹 How It Is Achieved

Through Method Overriding

Requires Inheritance

Uses Parent class reference → Child class object


| Feature      | Compile-Time       | Run-Time          |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Achieved by  | Method Overloading | Method Overriding |
| Binding Time | Compile Time       | Runtime           |
| Flexibility  | Less               | More              |
