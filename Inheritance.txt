🔹 Definition

Inheritance is an OOP principle where one class (child/subclass) acquires properties and behaviors of another class (parent/superclass).

It promotes code reusability and hierarchical relationships.

🔹 Syntax
class Child extends Parent {
    // child class code
}

| Type         | Supported with Classes | Example                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Single       | ✅ Yes                  | One parent → one child         |
| Multilevel   | ✅ Yes                  | Parent → child → grandchild    |
| Hierarchical | ✅ Yes                  | One parent → multiple children |
| Multiple     | ❌ Not with classes     | Achieved using Interfaces      |
| Hybrid       | ❌ Not directly         | Combination using Interfaces   |


🔹 Why Java Doesn’t Support Multiple Inheritance with Classes

To avoid the Diamond Problem (method ambiguity when two parent classes have same method).

🔹 Achieving Multiple Inheritance

Java uses Interfaces to support multiple inheritance.

A class can implement multiple interfaces.

🔹 Key Features

✔ Promotes code reusability
✔ Reduces code redundancy
✔ Establishes parent-child relationship
✔ Supports method overriding
✔ Enables runtime polymorphism

🔹 Example
class Animal {
    void eat() { }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { }
}

🔹 Advantages

Faster development

Easier maintenance

Improved scalability

Better code organization

🔹 Disadvantages

Tight coupling between parent and child

Changes in parent may affect child

🔹 Important Keywords

extends → for class inheritance

implements → for interface inheritance

super → access parent class members
