📘 Abstraction –  Notes
🔹 Definition

Abstraction is the OOP principle of hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features to the user.

It focuses on what an object does instead of how it does it.

🔹 Purpose

Reduces complexity

Hides unnecessary internal details

Improves code readability

Enhances maintainability

Supports loose coupling

🔹 How It Is Achieved in Java

Abstract Classes

Interfaces

🔹 Abstract Class

Declared using abstract keyword

Can contain abstract methods (no body)

Can also contain concrete methods (with body)

Cannot be instantiated directly

abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();
}

🔹 Interface

100% abstraction (before Java 8)

Contains only abstract methods

Implemented using implements keyword

interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

🔹 Key Features

✔ Hides implementation details
✔ Exposes only required functionality
✔ Improves flexibility
✔ Promotes reusability
✔ Supports polymorphism

🔹 Real-World Example

Car Driving

You use steering, accelerator, brake

You don’t need to know engine internals

🔹 Advantages

Easier system design

Better code organization

Simplifies large programs

Increases security
